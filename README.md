# European Air Traffic Dashboard
## Introduction
This is another pet project aiming at exploring Python and its frameworks (mainly Dash and Pandas) to create dashboards. 
My goal is to create a high-level view of the European air traffic in a nice and interactive way. The information comes from Aviation Intelligence Portal provided by EUROCONTROL: https://ansperformance.eu/data/ and https://www.eurocontrol.int/Economics/DailyTrafficVariation-States.html
## Technologies Used
The app is built using:
 - Pandas and NumPy to load and process data
 - Dash to visualise the data
 - Dash bootstrap components to make sure that the dashboard has a responsive layout

All needed packaged and dependencies are listed in the 'requirements.txt' file.
## Deployment
The dashboard is deployed on Heroku:

The 'Procfile' and 'runtime.txt' files are needed for Heroku deployment.
